# Hello!

### Made a few small changes from the design:
- On the web version (as in mobile), assuming that users can't search/ask questions without selecting an Assistant, I've hidden the sumbit icon and show it only after an assistant is selected.
- On desktop, after opening (or typing @) the asistants menu, you can selecte them with arrow keys (UP & DOWN) and hit Enter.
- Added that X (close) icon on desktop when users hover the Assistant added. May be changed with a swtich indicator or something else.




### Room for improvment:
- Not happy how I handled the textbox filed. Will need to re-structure a bit to make it more responsive with the width and when using multiple lines.
